Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning:
Consider an application environment with three groups of machines:
S-1, S-2, and S-3, where S-1, S-2, and S-3 include 8, 9, and 11 machines,
respectively. Each machine contains 38 sensors. A dataset is recorded
over time from the given environment. The dataset includes 28 instances
of multivariate time series data generated from 28 machines. Each multivariate
time series is recorded from 38 sensors over time. The challenge is
to propose a deep-learning model-based pipeline that can detect anomalies
in all instances of multivariate time series.
